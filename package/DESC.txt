Overview
========

Provides functions to score input records using PMML models and to interact with the Watson Machine Learning (WML) repository.
This package exposes the `com.ibm.streams.pmml` toolkit as Python methods.

For details on PMML see `Predictive Model Markup Language <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_Model_Markup_Language>`_.

For details on WML see `Watson Machine Learning Service <https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/analyze-data/ml-overview.html?context=analytics>`_.

This package is compatible with Streaming Analytics service on IBM Cloud:

* `IBM Streaming Analytics <https://www.ibm.com/cloud/streaming-analytics>`_
* `IBM Cloud Machine-Learning-Service <https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/machine-learning>`_


Sample
======

A simple example of a Streams application that uses PMML models for scoring::

    from streamsx.topology.topology import *
    from streamsx.topology.schema import CommonSchema, StreamSchema
    from streamsx.topology.context import submit
    import streamsx.pmml as pmml

    topo = Topology()

    # work in progress

    submit('STREAMING_ANALYTICS_SERVICE', topo)
